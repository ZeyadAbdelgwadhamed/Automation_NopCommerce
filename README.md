# Automation_NopCommerce
This project is a Java-based test automation project built using Selenium WebDriver, TestNG, and follows the Page Object Model (POM) design pattern. It is intended to automate the testing of a web application.

Features and Technologies:

Language: Java Automation Framework: Selenium WebDriver Test Framework: TestNG Design Pattern: Page Object Model (POM) Key Components:

Selenium WebDriver: Selenium WebDriver is a powerful tool for automating web browsers. It provides a robust API for interacting with web elements, performing actions, and accessing browser functionalities.

TestNG: TestNG is a testing framework for Java that provides enhanced functionality compared to JUnit. It allows you to organize and execute test cases, manage test dependencies, perform parallel test execution, generate test reports, and more.

Page Object Model (POM): The project follows the POM design pattern, which helps in creating a maintainable and modular test automation framework. The POM design pattern separates the web pages or application screens into individual Page classes. Each Page class encapsulates the elements and related actions on a specific page, providing a higher level of abstraction and reusability.

Project Structure: The project is organized into different packages and directories, following best practices for Java project structure. The structure may include the following directories:

src/main/java: Contains the main source code files for implementing the POM structure, including the Page classes, test data, utilities, and configuration files.

src/test/java: Contains the test classes that use the Page classes to execute test cases using TestNG annotations.

src/test/resources: Contains any additional resources required for testing, such as configuration files, test data files, or external libraries.

testng.xml: The TestNG configuration file that specifies the test suite, test classes, and other test execution settings.

Usage: To use this project, you can follow these steps:

- Clone or download the project repository from GitHub.
- Import the project into your preferred Java IDE (e.g., IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse).
- Install the necessary dependencies, including Selenium WebDriver, TestNG, and any other required libraries.
- Customize the project according to your specific application under test by modifying the Page classes, test data, and - -configuration files.
- Execute the test cases using TestNG and observe the test results and generated reports.
- By leveraging the power of Java, Selenium WebDriver, TestNG, and the POM design pattern, this project aims to provide a reliable and scalable test automation solution for web applications.
